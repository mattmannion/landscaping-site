Matt Mannion's React App setup w/ Parcel, TypeScript, and Sass.

create a src and dist folders in project root with the following files in src:

- index.html
- index.jsx/tsx
- app.jsx/tsx
- main.scss

  - [remember to also set the files up accordingly]

- delete git folder and modify gitignore to your needs.
  it is setup by default to ignore src and dist.

packages installed globally

- npm-run-all - using run-p
  - [using sequential]
- parcel
- rimraf for clearing dist/ and .cache/ for clean build

this repo is for my personal use only and is a WIP at all times.

found therein. thanks.
